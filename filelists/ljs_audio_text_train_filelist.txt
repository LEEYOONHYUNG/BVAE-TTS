LJ007-0114|A certain number, who could afford the high rate of a guinea per diem, fixed by the under sheriff, were lodged in the governor's house,

LJ004-0131|To specify more particularly one or two of the worst, it may be mentioned that in the Borough Compter

LJ032-0063|Since the rifle was shipped from Chicago on March twenty, nineteen sixty-three, it was received in Dallas during the period when Oswald rented and used the box.
LJ001-0176|because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether,

LJ023-0043|I want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis

LJ036-0093|If Oswald had made such a statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably have remembered it.

LJ014-0274|Rumors were abroad that serious defalcations had been discovered in one of the insurance offices,
LJ042-0181|Oswald realized that, quote, their thinking and education will be steeped in the traditions of those systems
LJ010-0073|he found himself rich in a small landed property, which he presently sold to a man who became bankrupt before he had paid over the purchase money.
LJ028-0354|And he honored Zopyrus greatly; year by year he presented him with all the gifts which are held in most esteem among the Persians;
LJ040-0239|Before the court took any action, the Oswalds left New York in January of nineteen fifty-four,

LJ041-0054|It probably contributed greatly to the general dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment,

LJ031-0141|It was decided that the Vice President should return on the Presidential plane rather than on the Vice-Presidential plane because it had better communication equipment.
LJ044-0073|It appears that Oswald had only one caller in response to all of his FPCC activities,
LJ028-0171|upon which was raised a second tower, and on that a third, and so on up to eight.
LJ031-0161|Secret Service agents working with police cleared the areas adjacent to the aircraft, including warehouses,

LJ005-0005|Even then they were not certain of the favor, for I find a reference to a decent and respectable woman sent to Newgate

LJ019-0125|But an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.

LJ039-0119|We have nothing here to show under what conditions the B course was fired. It might well have been a bad day for firing the rifle

LJ018-0209|It was not easy to detect coiners, or bring home their guilt to them.

LJ045-0022|even though he did, as he told Johnson, attend a meeting at which General Walker spoke to approximately thirteen hundred persons.

LJ048-0132|which would bring to bear the judgment and experience of members of the White House detail other than the advance agent.
LJ005-0133|The provision of separate sleeping cells was still quite inadequate. For instance,
LJ020-0022|Wash out the bowl with a little lukewarm water and add this to the dough. If it should prove too soft, work in, cautiously, a little more flour.
LJ022-0202|That faith is receiving its just reward.
LJ012-0003|The two men on guard had gone off immediately after Mr. Gee had escaped, but they returned later in the day, and were apprehended.
LJ015-0247|At that station the safes were given out, heavy with shot, not gold; the thieves went on to Dover, and by-and-by,

LJ013-0229|Courvoisier admitted that he had intended to bind it tightly round his arm and bleed himself to death in the night.

LJ046-0219|The above action should be taken without delay in order to attempt to verify the information and no evaluation of the information should be attempted.

LJ026-0157|This process is, however, obscured during the day because of the oxygen freed in the manufacture of starch which goes on at that time.
LJ038-0266|Frazier testified further that the FBI avoids the category of "probable" identification.

LJ005-0185|As time passed, however, these magistrates made no effort at reform.

LJ045-0031|During the week, Oswald lived in a roominghouse in Dallas, but he usually called his wife on the telephone twice a day.
LJ034-0063|none of these employees except Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.
LJ043-0148|She testified that she was agitated because she had found the note in Oswald's room,
LJ028-0069|how he cast Hebrew lads into a fiery furnace and into the lions' den,

LJ034-0147|Brennan stated that he was sure that the person firing the rifle was Oswald.

LJ008-0164|The most affecting and distressing scene was at Green Arbor Lane, just opposite the debtors' door of the prison.

LJ033-0104|When Frazier entered the building, he did not see Oswald.
LJ027-0110|Now, rudimentary organs of this kind are of such frequent occurrence, that almost every species of organism presents one or more of them
LJ040-0028|When he was in the United States he resented the capitalist system which he thought was exploiting him and others like him.
LJ031-0095|Before this was accomplished the President's cardiac activity had ceased and closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible to inspect his back.
LJ017-0257|and the prisoners eventually surrendered to the British authorities, brought to England, and lodged in Newgate.

LJ041-0082|in an attempt to attract attention to himself and to support his exaggerated idea of his own abilities.
LJ015-0159|In his person he was neat and fastidious;

LJ012-0244|The decapitation and dismemberment, the bestowal of the remains in various parts of the town, the preservation of the head in spirits of wine,
LJ038-0052|testified regarding the arrest of Oswald, as did the various police officers who participated in the fight.
LJ013-0031|The crime soon became public.

LJ028-0370|The priests' deception was unavailing, and in two seventy-five B.C., the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to Seleucia.
LJ037-0032|Benavides never saw Oswald after the arrest.

LJ028-0112|My father did that which no previous king had done.
LJ003-0279|There was fear as to the unrestricted use of tools,
LJ010-0130|Ings was especially defiant. He sought to cheer Davidson, who seemed affected, crying out,
LJ007-0047|"Men whose cases were dangerous, and those most seriously inclined, complained of these annoyances,"

LJ045-0189|it should be noted that mention of the Trade Mart as the expected site of the Presidential luncheon

LJ017-0117|The examination of the stomach betrayed the presence of antimony in large quantities, but no strychnia,
LJ039-0191|Oswald engaged in such practice. If the assassin missed either the first or third shot,
